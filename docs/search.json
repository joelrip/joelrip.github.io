    "text": "I’ve created an interactive map of childcare facilities and Kindergartens in the Sacramento area, color-coded by the percentage of students that are unvaccinated due to Personal Belief Exemptions (PBEs). Based on 2013-14 data from the California Department of Public Health. [Note: Not smartphone friendly.]\n[Editor’s Note January 2017: This map was created almost a year before the New York Times’ map using the same data. Admittedly, theirs is prettier, and it’s statewide.]\n[Editor’s Note March 2023: The interactive map is no longer available, as advancing technology has broken the original page. But I wanted to preserve my very first blog post for posterity!]\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{riphagen2014,\n  author = {Joel Riphagen},\n  title = {Mapping {Childhood} {Vaccination} in {Sacramento}},\n  date = {2014-04-20},\n  url = {https://joelrip.github.io/posts/2014-04-20-childhood-vaccination/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJoel Riphagen. 2014. “Mapping Childhood Vaccination in\nSacramento.” April 20, 2014. https://joelrip.github.io/posts/2014-04-20-childhood-vaccination/."
