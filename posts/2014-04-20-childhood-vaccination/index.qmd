I’ve created an interactive map of childcare facilities and Kindergartens in the Sacramento area, color-coded by the percentage of students that are unvaccinated due to Personal Belief Exemptions (PBEs). Based on 2013-14 data from the California Department of Public Health. _[Note: Not smartphone friendly.]_

_[Editor’s Note January 2017: This map was created almost a year before the New York Times’ map using the same data. Admittedly, theirs is prettier, and it’s statewide.]_

_[Editor's Note March 2023: The interactive map is no longer available, as advancing technology has broken the original page. But I wanted to preserve my very first blog post for posterity!]_
